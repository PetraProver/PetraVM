# zCrayVM
A verifiable supercomputer

## Overview
zCrayVM is a new virtual machine (zkVM) designed specifically for efficient execution within Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof systems, leveraging the [Binius](https://www.binius.xyz/) SNARK scheme's strengths. The primary goals are to improve performance of recursive proof verification and WebAssembly execution within ZK environments.

## Instruction Set
zCrayVM's full instruction set is divided into five categories—Binary field, Arithmetic & Logic, Memory, Control Flow, and Function Calls—and the prover's current support is noted below.

### Prover Support (Work in Progress)

> **Note:** In zCrayVM, variables refer to addresses in VROM (Value ROM, a write-once memory region). Instructions operate on values at these addresses unless specified as "immediate" operations.

> **Note:** Check out our [instruction set test suite](examples/opcodes.asm) for a complete overview of supported instructions and their usage.

#### Binary Field Operations

- [x] `B128_ADD` - 128-bit binary field addition
- [x] `B128_MUL` - 128-bit binary field multiplication

#### Arithmetic Operations
- [x] `ADD` - Integer addition
- [ ] `ADDI` - Integer addition with immediate

- [ ] `SLEIU` - Set if less than or equal immediate (unsigned)

#### VROM Operations
- [x] `LDI.W` - Load immediate word
- [x] `MVV.W` - Move word between addresses
- [x] `MVV.L` - Move 128-bit value between addresses
- [x] `MVI.H` - Move immediate half-word

#### Control Flow
- [x] `J` - Jump to label or address
    - [x] `JUMPI` - Jump to immediate address
    - [x] `JUMPV` - Jump to address in variable
