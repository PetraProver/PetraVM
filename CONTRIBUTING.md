## Dependencies

We use plenty of useful crates from the Rust ecosystem. When including a crate as a dependency, be sure to assess:

* Is it widely used? You can see when it was published and total downloads on `crates.io`.
* Is it maintained? If the documentation has an explicit deprecation notice or has not been updated in a long time, try
  to find an alternative.
* Is it developed by one person or an organization?## Dependencies

## First-time contributions

The project welcomes first time contributions from developers who want to learn more about PetraVM and make an impact
on the open source cryptography community.

If you are new to the project and don't know where to start, you can look for [open issues labeled
`good first issue`](/PetraProver/PetraVM/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A"good%20first%20issue") or add
test coverage for existing code. Adding unit tests is a great way to learn how to interact with the codebase, make a
meaningful contribution, and maybe even find bugs!

On the other hand, _we do not accept typo fix PRs from first-time contributors_. These are not significant enough to
justify the additional work for maintainers nor any potential benefits, tangible or intangible, one might get from
being listed as a contributor to the repo.
